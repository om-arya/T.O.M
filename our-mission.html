                    <p>As college students, we are endlessly running around to complete our various assignments. Going on a routine like this
                        leaves us stressed out and frazzled, having a way to motivate ourselves throughout the day is exactly what we needed. 
                        We created T.O.M. to give students an opportunity to boost their moods during their long days.
