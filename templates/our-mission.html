                <p>As college students, it sometimes feels as if we are endlessly running around to complete our various assignments. A routine like this
                    can leave us stressed out and frazzled, and having a way to motivate ourselves throughout the day is exactly what we needed. 
                    We created T.O.M. to give students like us an opportunity to boost their moods during their long days.
