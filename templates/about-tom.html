                <h1>Why Did We Create T.O.M.?</h1>
                <p>A tight-knit team of four college sophomores, we are more than familiar with the everyday stresses college students experience. 
                    We used our experiences overcoming these struggles in tandem with our backgrounds in computer science to create a tool that could help 
                    alleviate stress for college students. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Whether it’s through his adorable design, helpful nature, or quirky quotes, T.O.M. was created to help students relax, regain their 
                    groove, and move on to their next goal feeling more empowered than ever. This project is a testament to the new skills we’ve learned 
                    from our first years in college, our passion for creative problem solving, and love for adorable felines. We hope you feel it too!

                <h1>How Was T.O.M. Made?</h1>
                <p>
                    While no one really knows how such a wise and helpful feline is born (the stars must have aligned right, we guess!), 
                    what we do know is how we brought T.O.M.’s presence alive in your devices. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This web application was written in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python on Visual Studio Code, with the assistance of front-end designing tools like Figma. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To enable most of its core features, T.O.M. leverages Gemini API through the Google AI Studio. Specifically, generating T.O.M.'s wisdom, accepting user 
                    requests and preferences in the Schedule Builder feature, and customizing the look of the Tomodoro feature based on user inputs. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On the back-end, T.O.M. relies on a Django framework in order to implement its customized chatbot interfaces and facilitate user interactions with the Gemini API. 
                    This framework allows us to generate customized queries to send to the Gemini API to receive the exact results we want, and use those results to use in our features. 
                    To enable users to hear T.O.M.’s meowjestic voice for themselves, we also included a text-to-speech feature utilizing the SpeechSynthesis interface of the Web Speech API. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We embarked on a journey of exploration through this project, employing a variety of tools foreign to nearly all of us when we began. This not only allowed us to create 
                    a dynamic project page but also significantly enhanced our technical skillset, and we're feline quite accomplished with the results of this project!
