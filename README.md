<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project üìò
<a id="about-the-project"></a>
As college students, it sometimes feels as if we are endlessly running around to complete our various assignments. A routine like this can leave us stressed out and frazzled, and having a way to motivate ourselves throughout the day is exactly what we needed. We created T.O.M. to give students like us an opportunity to boost their moods during their long days.
